SAFETY TIPS

To ensure a safe and effective marketplace, BoatTrader.com strongly recommends that you consider the following before you proceed:

- Verify the legitimacy of the buyer in person or by telephone. Be cautious of any buyer who wants to communicate ONLY via email.
                                                
- If the buyer pays by cashier's check, verify with the ISSUING bank that the account exists and contains sufficient funds and/or allow at least 10 business days after deposit to ensure that the money will fully clear the bank and NOT be reclaimed from your account if counterfeit.

- Beware of overpayment schemes where the buyer sends a check for more than the amount owed and asks you to refund a portion. The buyer's check is probably NOT valid.

- BoatTrader, its affiliated websites, and Boats Group do NOT offer 'Payment Protection Programs,' 'Verified Seller,' or escrow services of any type.

- BoatTrader, its affiliated websites, and Boats Group will NEVER send you email messages requesting your personal information, such as credit card numbers or your login/password. If you receive an email message requesting such information, DO NOT provide your personal information. Please forward any such emails to fraudalert@boattrader.com.

- Be cautious with international sellers.
